    <p>Dear Hafsa,
      <br>
      Happy birthday! Today is a special day to celebrate the wonderful person that you are. As you turn another year older, I want you to know how much you mean to me.
      <br>
      You have a heart of gold and a contagious smile that lights up any room. You are a true friend, always there to lend a listening ear and offer a helping hand. You have a way of making people feel special and loved, and for that, I am forever grateful to have you in my life.
      <br>
      On your special day, I wish you all the happiness, love and laughter in the world. May your day be filled with joy and surrounded by loved ones. You deserve nothing but the best, and I hope that this year brings you everything you wish for and more.
      <br>
      I am looking forward to many more years of friendship and memories together. Enjoy your birthday, and know that you are loved and appreciated.
      <br>
      Sincerely,
    <br>
      Tayyab Irfan

      <br>
      ya chahat ka mujh pr kamal hai k tum ban'na bs meri...
